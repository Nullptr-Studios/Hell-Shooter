## How to improve controller support
Taking a look in games like _Minishoot adventure_ and _Enter the Gungeon_, we can set apart various aspects tht makes our controller support feel weird:

- Modern bullet hell games usually have implemented a sort of target-lock and bullet redirectioning for controller players, HS lacks implementation of that thus making the aiming process far more difficult
- I like Minishoot's aproach to firing: when the right stick is moved it automatically starts shooting. Our game in comparison makes it tedious by having the R2 button on the controller almost always pressed down since a bullet hell shooter is, in essence, a shmup.
